# Tendies Ticker

A really simple and sloppy Discord bot for checking live price data on stocks and cryptocurrencies. Responds with a live price for any valid US stock and most crypto symbols. Ex. mentioning $AMD will return the live price or market closing price.

To use it you'll need an API key from Alpha Vantage which you can find [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and an API key from CoinMarketCap which can be found [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

1. Copy the .env.example into .env and set the variables.
2. Run `npm run start`.
3. Hook it up to your discord channel.
